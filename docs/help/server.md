# Server

This guide will explain how to setup an AllTheMods server locally, or with a server host.

---

## Prerequisites

- [x] Server with at-least **8GB**+ RAM (_As required for most ATM packs_).
- [x] CPU that's atleast **3.5Ghz** of speed.
- [x] Specific [Java](java.md) version based on the pack **Minecraft** version.

---

## Installation

- Download modpack **Server-Files** from **CurseForge**.
- Extract **Server-Files** to a folder.

!!! Warning "If you've a 3rd party Anti-Virus installed, exclude the folder the files will be extracted too, as files may get remove or corrupted after extracting."

---

### Java

If you have multiple [Java](java.md) versions installed, the default `java -version` will be used, which may not be the correct version based on the **Minecraft** version. There's 3 solutions,

- Edit the server script, changing `java` to correct java binary path.
    - Ex: `"C:\Program Files\Java\jre-17\bin\java.exe" @user_jvm_args.txt ...`
- Remove old / add the correct **java/bin** path to **System Environment Variables** > Path
- **Linux**, you can re-configure [Java](java.md) using `sudo update-alternatives --config java`
- Uninstall all [Java](java.md) versions except the one being used.

!!! Note "If you've installed [Java](java.md), you may need to restart OS."

--- 

### Local Installation

- Extract **Server-Files** to a folder.
- **Window**: Do not unzip files under **OneDrive** or any other cloud folder, as this can potentially remove / corrupt files.
- **Linux**: Ensure server folder has read/write permission, and script has execute permission,
    - To avoid any _read/write_ permission errors, install server under `/home/<user>/` folder.
    - Run once: `sudo chmod +x startserver.sh`.
- Starting Server: 
    - **Windows**: Execute `startserver.bat`
    - **Linux**: Execute `./startserver.sh`

After running, you're required to accept [Minecraft Eula](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) in the `eula.txt` file.

Make any changes necessary to `server.properties`, `configs`, and or `world/serverconfigs`, and run `startserver.bat/sh` again to start the server. 

???+ Warning
    Many guides tell you to edit `server-ip` or `server-port`. In most cases you **DO NOT** need to edit these, especially `server-ip`. This can prevent your server from starting.

??? Note "There's no `startserver.bat/sh` script?"
    Install **Forge** first,

    - `java -jar forge-installer*.jar --installServer`
    - You will then instead `run.bat/sh` to start server.

    ??? Tip "There's no `run.bat/sh`?"
        Expecting this is an older Forge version, you'll need to create a script that launches Forge.
        ``` title='run.bat/sh'
        java -Xms4G -Xmx8G -jar forge-*universal.jar
        ```

??? Note "How to allocate RAM or add Arguments?"
    Allocating RAM and or adding Arguments are applied within `usr_jvm_args.txt`. Older versions of **Forge** will require adding arguments in the script file, if that file doesn't exist.

??? Note "How To Import A World?"
    Upload world folder to server folder. Make sure the world folder is named `world`.

!!! Tip "Performance Tips: Check out [Lag / Profiling](lag.md)"

### Server Host Installation

Most server host has a one-click server installer you can use, otherwise

- If possible, setup a fresh **Forge** server based on the current **Forge** version of the pack.
    - If host has no **Forge** installer, read [Server Host Custom Jar](#server-host-custom-jar)
- Upload extracted **Server-Files** to host, via **FTP** or **STFP**.
    - To connect to **FTP**/**SFTP**, you could use a client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).
    - If there's no **FTP**/**SFTP**, you may be able to upload the **Server-Files** zip, and extract on server host via their online **File Manager**.
 

---

## Server Host Custom Jar

If server host requires a `.jar` file, later **Forge** versions cannot be ran directly. If older, you can upload and use the `forge-*universal.jar` as custom jar. Extract & Upload **Server-Files** to main server folder. **Otherwise**,

- Download [ServerStarter](https://github.com/BloodyMods/ServerStarter/releases) jar, then upload to main server folder. Use this as the custom jar.
- Download pack **Server-Files** from **CurseForge**, extract, and upload **ALL** to main server folder.
- Create a file named `server-setup-config.yaml`, and copy / paste the config example below. 

Modifiy config for pack if necessary, specifically the `mcVersion` and `loaderVersion`, and place config in server root then start server as normal.

??? Info "Config Example | ATM9"

    **Highlighted lines are important to be configured**

    ```yaml title='server-setup-config.yaml' hl_lines="4 5 7 8 30"
    # Version of the specs, only for internal usage if this format should ever change drastically
    _specver: 2
    modpack:
        name: ATM9
        description: All The Mods 9
    install:
        mcVersion: 1.20.1
        loaderVersion: 47.2.19
        installerUrl: "https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/{{@mcversion@}}-{{@loaderversion@}}/forge-{{@mcversion@}}-{{@loaderversion@}}-installer.jar"
        installerArguments:
            - "--installServer"
        modpackFormat: zip
        baseInstallPath: ~
        checkFolder: true
        installLoader: true
        connectTimeout: 30
        readTimeout: 30
    launch:
        crashLimit: 10
        maxRam: 8
        minRam: 4
        crashTimer: 60min
        preJavaArgs: ~
        startFile: "forge-{{@mcversion@}}-{{@loaderversion@}}.jar"
        startCommand:
            - "@user_jvm_args.txt"
            - "@libraries/net/minecraftforge/forge/{{@mcversion@}}-{{@loaderversion@}}/{{@os@}}_args.txt"
            - "nogui"
        forcedJavaPath: ~
        supportedJavaVersions: [17]
    ```

    - `mcVersion`: Minecraft Version
    - `loaderVersion`: Forge Version
    - `supportedJavaVersions`: Supported Java Version(s)

## Updating

Updating ATM servers is pretty simple. There's 3 ways you can accomplish this. 

!!! Danger "**BACKUP** world before proceeding."

### **Automatic**

1. If you have a server host with a modpack installer, usually you can do a one-click update within your control panel.

### **Manually**

1. Backup any modified configs or kubejs scripts, _if any_, to be replaced later.
    - Download **Server Files** from **CurseForge**
    - Delete `kubejs`, `defaultconfigs`, `mods`, and `config` folder.
    - If server forge version is different, delete `libraries` folder, and copy over new `startserver.bat/sh`, & `forge-installer.jar` _if exists_.
    - Extract the deleted folders from **Server Files** into your server folder.

2. Download **Server Files** from **CurseForge**.
    - Extract **Server Files** to a new folder.
    - Copy `world` folder, `server.properties`, & `eula.txt` to new server folder.
    - If `journeymap` folder exist, copy over aswell.
    - _Copy over any modified server configs/kubejs scripts_
